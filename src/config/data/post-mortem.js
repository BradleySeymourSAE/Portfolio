    I discovered that while working on this project, I ran into trouble implementing event systems, which led me to spending a significant amount of time debugging errors rather than determining why the errors could be occurring.
    This happened, I believe, because I jumped right into the project without thinking about the changes and concepts that I would be implementing to the project as a whole. This made trying to debug the project as a whole quite difficult and I ran into constant breaking changes, unorganized code and general confusion within the project. I would find myself spending countless hours of time on one issue rather than taking a step back, or trying again when my head was in a clear space. 
    To begin, I revisited Nathan's video tutorial project 'Space Invaders' to refresh my memory on using events, which ultimately led me to find naming convention methods that would further help my understanding of delegates. With a clear mind, I turned the project around by deleting the majority of the code I had written in the project and beginning from scratch, often using the project's starting point as a guide. I wrote about how I intended to approach the AI system, which helped me take my gaze away from the screen. This helped me navigate the framework I had in mind when it came time to programme the logic.
    Towards the end of week 9, the project's deadline started to draw close and I had quite a confusing project with many errors that needed working through, leading to stress that I would not have a completed project. I decided to tackle this by removing AI infantry characters from the AI enemy wave spawn system and removing UI that was not working or being displayed.
    This was due to a lack of preparation prior to starting the project after it had been allocated to me. If I had taken a step back to begin with and worked on the Flow Chart as suggested by Nathan and myself in my previous project, I may not have encountered as many issues. However, from an optimistic perspective, I learned several different approaches when tackling the project in this manner.
    By eliminating time-consuming and unnecessary features from the project. This enabled me more time to clean up unwanted code and stay focused on the improvements I'd made. Which took a huge pressure off my shoulders and found the project much easier to navigate as a whole, leading in me carrying out the project not just on time, as well as at a standard that I am proud of.

    After showing my partner the scene I had created for the project after constructing the user interface and 3D models, I wanted to get her opinion to ensure that the setting matched the design and aesthetic touch that I planned.  During this playtest, I discovered that the object I had hidden had been hidden far too well, in the sense that you couldn't actually read it. The reason for this is that it was obstructed in a specific way by the surrounding environment (no spoilers). After some further playtests I was able to adjust the landscape and fix that issue relatively quickly. My partner had also pointed out that the movement speed was too fast for the calm background audio that is heard while playing the game. 
    I believe that during this project by listening to constructive feedback that I had received from my partner as well as other students. I was able to discover errors within the project and other design aspects that I wouldn't have seen or thought about at first, allowing me to rectify the issues before the project was due and to a standard I am proud of. Moving forward from here, I believe that the lesson that could be learnt from this is to continue to outsource information and listen to the feedback received from friends and family, possibly looking in the future I could make a start on this by adding a suggestion feedback form, as well as a comments section on my google site. 
    I had initially been finding it difficult to find inspiration for an asset to create for this project in particular. I knew that because this subject involves game design and asset creation that I would find it difficult to manage my time while working on the project, which was evident and clear to me from working with website development in the past.  I initially wanted to create a Nissan Silvia s15 which with the limited knowledge with 3d modelling in blender, I likely would have struggled with in relation to keeping the project within scope.  I came to terms that It would be best to move the s15 to a side project and began researching and outsourcing information in other areas of interest, where I had eventually decided to work on an Alpine Village House that my brother had designed the floorplans of. 
    I believe that by deciding to scrap the S15 and deferring from rushing headfirst into the project, I was able to better plan the project and assign the necessary time to complete various stages. I did, however, encounter an issue after devoting significant time to the modelling process, which had an affect on other areas I am studying. This occurred as a result of my inability to prioritise other areas of study due to the personal importance of the task.
    I like that I was able to identify that the project was too large for my scope and that, despite this, I continued the project as a side project rather than abandoning it entirely. Time and task management is unquestionably an important lesson to be drawn from this project as well as learning how to prioritise tasks in order to provide not just the best results - but also the most efficient results within a timeframe. In the future I will be leaning more towards striking a healthier balance between placing projects on hold and allowing a backlog of work to accumulate.

    I had discovered that by drawing the assets on paper before attempting to create them within blender, I was able to more efficiently use my time when I made a start on modelling them. In addition to that, I was able to better set time aside to complete the different elements of the project in order. Using the asset checklist had helped to analyse my progress while working on the project, cut assets that would be considered out of scope and organise the little time I had left over in the project to create a scene I am proud of! 
    I strongly believe that this could have been because I work well with checklists as apposed to having tasks spread out in my hack n plan. I find it incredibly difficult to sort the priority of different projects and tasks and if there are too many deliverables due at once and I want to do well in a certain project. I will always, without fail, pick what I believe is the highest of my priorities. This doesn't necessarily mean its the wrong or right choice but more-so that Its difficult to manage sometimes! 
    One of the lessons to take from here is to continue drawing the assets on paper and continue to use an asset checklist to keep on top of the different areas of the project that need to be completed. The benefits of using a checklist and planning things out in the future outweighs the time it takes in preparing the documents. I did find that I was able to create much better assets that required little effort when importing into Unity because the asset had been created to scale and had the transforms set appropriately. 
    Another key take away from this project that I would adjust slightly if I were to start it again is that It would have been more beneficial to stretch the asset and scene creation side of the project more towards the middle of the four weeks instead of spending the majority of the project planning and preparing the asset specifications and leaving myself little time towards the last week. In the future It would be incredibly valuable lesson to find the balance between these things moving forward from here. This is so that I can avoid getting stuck on smaller, less significant elements like the light switch and the light itself which hadn't been the scene's initial models, and they didn't even turn out that well compared to the other assets that had been created, they had also taken up most of the time - go figure.  So, in the future, I suppose I'll just stick to the asset planning documentation! I've started adding more notes into my hack n plan, as well as logging the work I've done so far and is a good process to continue doing, the reason for this is because the comments are incredibly helpful when it comes to referring to past content that had been taught and has allowed me to maintain a steady lead on the deliverables.  I think that incorporating more checkbox 'subtasks' into their own task could potentially help me when attempting to organise my work. This was made clear to me after discovering I was doing huge sections for a single subject at a time and because I had been unable to prioritise a specific task, I wouldn't understand what the next step would be. 
    During this project I spent time experimenting with post processing effects, lighting and other tools to improve the quality of my work despite not having learnt the material yet. I surprised myself with the quality of the scene that I had created. It goes to show that branching off and researching into different tools that can be used can improve the quality of the project substantially. 
    Additionally, I had identified during this project that I had a weakness in UV Wrapping and this would definitely be an area that I could further improve in. I was having difficulties remembering the content that I had been taught during class on unwrapping textures and I found myself beginning to run short on time in re-learning this particular area. 
    I believe that this had occured because despite not having learned the particular topic, I had decided to spend time experimenting with post-processing effects, lighting, and other tools to enhance the quality of my work throughout this assignment because of feedback I had received from my family stating that the prison was fairly bright for what I had been intending. Using that knowledge to my advantage and applying the feedback received, I was completely astounded at the sheer quality of the scene I had produced just from the lighting and post processing effects themselves! 
    I was able to find a tool called UV-Unpacker that would help me wrap textures that are a little more complicated , adding in the seams and separating each of the sections of a texture! I believe that by reflecting on my weaknesses and undertaking some research into addons that could assist me in that area, I was able to wrap more complicated elements quickly and continue making progress on my project, completing the deliverables on time! 
    It goes to demonstrate that branching out and exploring other technologies that may be utilised can significantly enhance the quality of the project. I think that this is an important lesson that I have learnt during this trimester, even since the first project. Continuing to outsource information, listening to feedback on further improvements you could make to a project, can lead you on different paths and enhance your own general knowledge in the long run! 
    While finding the blender addon tools did assist me during the time to meet the deadline, I think that moving forward It would be a good idea to revisit the tutorial video that Erika had shown us during the first few weeks of the trimester. The reason for this is because UV unwrapping is a very important part of asset creation and an addon isn't going to work perfectly every time around and could potentially break in the future.

    With the amount of detail and quality of both the assets and the scene our team had developed, this project surpassed both mine and my team's expectations! Communication had been a critical element when working on this project, and being able to make choices quickly and effectively, as well as work around any issues that arose due to merging, had been beneficial in completing the project within the scope our team had set. Furthermore, our team had finished the documentation extremely fast and had a very clear concept of what we wanted to show in terms of the level's design and what we had set out to accomplish without any problems or competing views! I've noticed a significant progress in my usage of the 3D modelling program, blender and with Martyn's sharing of various techniques and addons has further extended my knowledge of rapidly iterating on prototype materials! I'm going to guess that Jessy is stating in his post mortem entry that he didn't put in enough work on the project or something along those lines, which is certainly not the case. He had built a lot of the important assets for the level's interior, and there was no way in hell I could build such detailed smooth models in such a short amount of time. It's also worth noting that being in a group with Jessy has made me want to accomplish and aim even higher for this project, and I believe this is due to his enthusiasm and social presence. His attitude alone is enough to lift anybody, and his sheer thirst for knowledge is inspirational and one of his strongest soft talents. 
    Finally, I discovered that I was always adding notes to my hack n plan; by organising those notes into subtasks, I was able to split each individual task down and stay focused on any remaining work that needed to be done, which increased my productivity tenfold. 
    This may have happened because I had gone out and investigated other helpful methods that had greatly increased the productivity of our development team, particularly in terms of utilising scriptable objects for dealing with audio components. I believe that reaching out to experienced developers in the industry and having those conversations on workable solutions to specific problems has been very beneficial. Our team was readily able to handle merging disputes and rapidly adjust to those modifications along the road, finding out effective solutions to problems that had been encountered, which links back into the communication component of our project! I am certain that the project was a success since we were all teaching and learning from one another, whether it was programming terms, level design, or even social elements! 
    I believe the lesson here is to keep branching out, exploring different methods and technologies that may help not just myself, but also other members of the team, rapidly iterate and improve their workflow inside the unity editor. Another takeaway from this is to keep going back and revising old documentation and processes because it's important to understand that you can't learn everything and be expected to retain all of that information at any given point in time; knowing where to look for those resources will only improve the end result of what you create!
    Furthermore, communication was the second major takeaway from the team to which I had been assigned. It was one of, if not the, greatest group projects I've ever worked on in my whole life. The communication was excellent, the work ethic of all team members in my team was amazing, and I honestly do not have a single bad experience to share from working with our team. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do after finishing the course, but working with Martyn and Jessy for the previous four weeks had given me enough confidence in myself to express that I really think we could establish an independent game development studio in the future. That's how great things went!
    I think that in order to continue improving my time management skills, I should keep putting tasks for the project aside in the sequence in which I plan to tackle them! Furthermore, delving deep into the documentation early on has only benefited our project and is an essential lesson to take away from this!
